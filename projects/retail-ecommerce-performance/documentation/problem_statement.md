This project analyses historical retail transaction data to understand overall business performance. The objective is to provide an interactive view of revenue, order behaviour, customer activity, and geographic performance to support data-driven decision-making.

## Key business questions include:
- How is revenue trending over time?
- Which countries and products contribute most to revenue?
- What is the average order value and customer behaviour across markets?
- How can insights from the data inform inventory planning and sales strategy?
