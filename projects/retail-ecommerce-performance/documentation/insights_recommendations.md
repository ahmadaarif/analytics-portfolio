## Executive Summary
- Total Revenue: £600.09K
- Orders: ~1,000
- Customers: 949
- Average Order Value (AOV): £450.86

## Key Insights
1. **Revenue concentration by geography**
   - The United Kingdom generates the majority of total revenue, followed by the Netherlands and EIRE.
   - This indicates a strong reliance on a small number of core markets.

2. **Seasonal revenue trends**
   - Monthly revenue peaks during mid-year periods, suggesting seasonality in purchasing behaviour.
   - Revenue declines in later months may indicate demand slowdowns or stock constraints.

3. **High-value product dominance**
   - A small group of products (e.g. Regency Cake Stand, Party Bunting) contributes disproportionately to total revenue.
   - This highlights both revenue drivers and concentration risk.

4. **High Average Order Value**
   - An AOV of £450+ suggests bulk or wholesale-style transactions rather than low-value consumer purchases.
   - This aligns with the presence of high-volume orders and limited customer churn.

## Recommendations
1. **Protect and grow core markets**
   - Prioritise inventory availability, logistics, and targeted promotions in the UK and top-performing countries.

2. **Plan around seasonality**
   - Use historical monthly trends to forecast demand and align stock planning ahead of peak periods.

3. **Reduce product concentration risk**
   - Bundle high-performing products with mid-tier items to increase product diversity and stabilise revenue.

4. **Leverage high AOV behaviour**
   - Introduce tiered pricing or volume-based incentives to further increase order value while retaining key customers.
