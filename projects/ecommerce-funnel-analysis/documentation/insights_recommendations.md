**E-commerce Funnel & Conversion Analysis (October 2019)**

## Key Business Insights

### 1. Significant drop-off at the View → Cart stage  
Only **17.9%** of users who view a product proceed to add it to their cart, meaning **over 80% of users drop off before showing purchase intent**.

**Insight:**  
This indicates that while product discovery is strong, most users are not sufficiently motivated to take the next step. Possible contributing factors include unclear value propositions, pricing sensitivity, lack of trust signals, or insufficient product information at the browsing stage.


### 2. Strong purchase intent once items reach the cart  
The **Cart → Purchase conversion rate is 65.3%**, indicating that users who add items to cart are highly likely to complete their purchase.

**Insight:**  
Checkout friction appears relatively low, and the cart stage effectively captures users with genuine buying intent. This suggests that improvements earlier in the funnel are likely to have a greater impact than changes to checkout alone.


### 3. Overall conversion is healthy but constrained by early-stage engagement  
The **overall View → Purchase conversion rate is 11.7%**, which is realistic for an e-commerce platform and largely driven by strong cart-to-purchase performance rather than browsing engagement.

**Insight:**  
The funnel is not fundamentally broken; instead, its performance is limited by weak engagement before cart addition.


### 4. Conversion performance is stable over time  
Daily conversion rates remain relatively consistent across the month, with moderate fluctuations but no extreme volatility.

**Insight:**  
This stability suggests that conversion issues are structural rather than driven by short-term anomalies such as technical incidents or isolated campaigns.


## Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: Optimise product detail pages to improve View → Cart conversion  
As the largest drop-off occurs before cart addition, optimisation efforts should focus on the browsing experience, including:

- Clearer product pricing and promotions  
- Stronger trust signals (reviews, ratings, delivery guarantees)  
- Improved product imagery and descriptions  
- More prominent and clearer “Add to Cart” calls to action  

**Expected impact:**  
Even a small improvement in View → Cart conversion would result in a meaningful increase in purchases due to the high volume of users at the top of the funnel.


### Recommendation 2: Leverage strong cart-to-purchase intent with targeted nudges  
Given the high likelihood of purchase once users reach the cart, further gains may be achieved through:

- Cart reminder prompts or exit-intent messaging  
- Incentives such as free delivery thresholds or limited-time offers  
- Continued simplification of cart and checkout steps  

**Expected impact:**  
Incremental improvements at this stage compound effectively, particularly during high-traffic periods.


### Recommendation 3: Segment funnel performance to identify high-impact opportunities  
Future analysis should segment funnel performance by:

- Product category  
- New versus returning users  
- High-view, low-cart categories  

**Expected impact:**  
Segment-level insights allow optimisation efforts to be prioritised where the potential return is highest, rather than applying broad, less targeted changes.


## Analyst Notes

- Funnel metrics were calculated at **user level**, ensuring each step represents users who progressed through previous stages.  
- Python and SQL analyses were cross-validated to ensure consistency of results.  
- Due to dataset size constraints, a representative sample was used while preserving behaviour across the full month.  
- Power BI dashboards were designed to clearly separate **overall funnel performance** from **daily trend analysis**.


## Executive Summary

The platform demonstrates **strong purchase intent once users add items to cart**, but a **significant opportunity exists to improve early-stage engagement**. Prioritising optimisation of the browsing and product discovery experience is likely to deliver the greatest impact on overall conversion and revenue.
