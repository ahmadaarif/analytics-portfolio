## Background
Understanding how users move through the e-commerce purchase funnel is critical for improving conversion rates and revenue. By analysing user behaviour data, businesses can identify where customers drop off and prioritise optimisation efforts.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyse an e-commerce funnel using event-level user data to:
- Measure conversion rates between key funnel stages
- Identify major drop-off points
- Provide data-driven recommendations to improve funnel performance

## Funnel Definition
The funnel consists of the following stages:
1. Product View
2. Add to Cart
3. Purchase

## Key Questions
- What proportion of users progress through each funnel stage?
- Where is the largest drop-off in the funnel?
- How can conversion rates be improved based on observed behaviour?
